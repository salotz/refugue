** Use Dry Run to see changes

Use of the dry-run is recommended before each transfer!! It is fast
and easy to do and allows you to see exactly will happen.

#+begin_src bash
refugue --dry source/main target/main
#+end_src

** Look at only the changed files needing backups

If you want to just see how the existing files on a target will change
use the 'inject' sync policy flag.

This will give you some idea of what files might be destroyed and in
need of backup because it ignores creating or deleting new files.

This will show the files that will be changed without
"clobbering". That is only files on target that have older timestamps
than on source:

#+begin_src bash
refugue --dry --sync='i' source/main target/main
#+end_src

You can add clobbering too to see if it is okay:

#+begin_src bash
refugue --dry --sync='i,k' source/main target/main
#+end_src
