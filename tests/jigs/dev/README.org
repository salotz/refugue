* Setting Up an environment for testing refugue

This is a bit of a delicate matter since it involves global stuff like
users and their home directories.

There is mechanisms for not using these for users but they are
advanced features, and we need to test the basic features first before
we move on to testing these advanced ones.

Here is my notes for setting this up. It should be transferred into a
'mock' plugin group for testing mock users and such.

** Setting up for testing

First set up a new user on your dev computer.

We use the namespace for general testing of this stuff: ~test~
followed by the application you are testing ~refugue~ and then
increment a number at the end for each test.

The invoke tasks should take care of this for you. e.g.

#+begin_src bash
inv admin.users
#+end_src

We specify an entire collection of users and passwords at once for
each test mockup which we can build up and tear down easily.

#+begin_src toml

  username_prefix = "test-refugue_"

  [[users]]

  id = "00"
  password = "Vae7Quae"
  groups = []

  [[users]]

  id = "01"
  password = "Rie9vaiX"
  groups = []
#+end_src

The ~id~ for each user will be appended to the ~username_prefix~ at
creation time.

You can generate a password for it with ~pwgen~:

#+begin_src bash
pwgen 8 1
#+end_src

Since some systems I am testing on will require some sort of 'real'
password.
