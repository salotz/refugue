** TODO 0000: Support the "fill-in" option                          :feature:

Add an option in the sync flag for fillin which will only add new
files and will ignore the existing ones.

Basically it uses the rsync flag: ~--ignore-existing~

It would look something like:

#+begin_src bash
refugue --sync='f' src dest
#+end_src
